In this part, we will see how to fully calculate the dimensions of a bevel gear tooth, such as the interference function and more useful parameters.

# Interference function

In the same way as *spur gears*, bevel gear profiles are involute function rolling on a spherical rack as we saw in the first part.
It involves potential interferences between teeth which has to be determined.

The rack is composed of a height (associated to $a$) and a width (associated to $b$).
Both coefficients $a$ and $b$ can form an *offset vector*, we set $\alpha$ and $\beta$ the offset angles:
$$
\alpha = \frac{a}{\rho_1}
$$
$$
\beta = \frac{b}{\rho_1}
$$

The rack follows the same trajectory as the spherical involute function on the point on the rack pitch circle.

![Figure 1 : Vectors for interference function](interference-params.png)

In order to get the right positions with offsets, a third vector $\overrightarrow{\gamma_{int}(t)}$ in <span style="background:#100F0F; color:#ffff00;border-radius:5px;padding:2px;">yellow</span> is introduced as the cross product of $\overrightarrow{\gamma(t)}$ and $\overrightarrow{\gamma'(t)}$:

$$
\overrightarrow{\gamma_{int}(t)} = \overrightarrow{\gamma(t)} \land \overrightarrow{\gamma'(t)} = \begin{pmatrix}
	-\cos(\gamma_p) \cos(t) \\
	-\cos(\gamma_p) \sin(t) \\
    \sin(\gamma_p)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

::: {.callout-warning}
In opposite of the spherical involute function, the cone angle used here is the pitch one $\gamma_p$ and not the base one $\gamma_b$ because the pitch cone base of the pinion is rolling on the pitch circle of the rack.
:::

Now the interference function can be introduced as:
$$
\boxed{
    \overrightarrow{\theta(t)} = \rho_1 \left( \cos(\alpha) \cdot \overrightarrow{\theta(t + t_0)} + \sin(\alpha) \cdot \overrightarrow{\gamma_{int}(t + t_0)} \right)
}
$$
where $t_0$ is the angular offset which contains $\beta$.

## Determination of $\alpha$ and $\beta$

Previously, we found the relation to compute the the addendum cone angle:
$$
\gamma_f = \gamma_p + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {k_a m} {\rho_1}\right) = \gamma_p + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {2 k_a \sin(\gamma_p)} z\right)
$$

In other words, $\alpha$ is the offset angle to $\gamma_p$:
$$
\boxed{\alpha = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {k_a m} {\rho_1}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {2 k_a \sin(\gamma_p)} z\right)}
$$

For the angle $\beta$, we have to resort to computations in order to get its value.

# Useful relations and expressions

::: {.callout-note}
By using angles of rotation on figure 2, the involute function can be found again by using the expression of $P$ on the system $S_0(\vec x_0, \vec y_0, \vec z_0)$ and multiplying by rotation matrices $S_0 \to S_1$, $S_1 \to S_2$, $S_2 \to S_3$ between systems.

By taking the length of the arc $MP$, which is the same length as $MQ$, we notice that:

$$
\rho_1 \cdot \varphi = r_b (\phi + \theta) = \rho_1 \sin(\gamma_b) \times \epsilon
$$

So we find the following relation:

$$
\boxed{
	\varphi = \epsilon \sin(\gamma_b) \quad \text{(1)}
}
$$

::: {.callout-note}
The variable $\epsilon$ is the same variable as $t$ found in the involute function.

With the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines#In_non-Euclidean_geometry), the angle $\gamma$ can be expressed as:

$$
\cos(\gamma) = \cos(\varphi) \cos(\gamma_b) + \sin(\varphi) \sin(\gamma_b) \cos(90°) = \cos(\varphi) \cos(\gamma_b)
$$

and

$$
\cos(\varphi) = \cos(\gamma_b) \cos(\gamma) + \sin(\gamma_b) \sin(\gamma) \cos(\phi)
$$

With the [law of sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines#Spherical_law_of_sines), the angle $\gamma$ can be also expressed as:
$$
\frac {\sin(\varphi)} {\sin(\phi)} = \frac {\sin(\gamma)} {\sin(90°)} = \frac {\sin(\gamma_b)} {\sin(\eta)}
$$
In other words:
$$
\sin(\gamma) = \frac {\sin(\varphi)} {\sin(\phi)}
$$

By using these both laws, we get:
$$
\cos(\varphi) = \cos(\varphi) \cos^2(\gamma_b) + \frac {\sin(\gamma_b) \sin(\varphi)} {\tan(\phi)}
$$
which can be simplified as:
$$
\tan(\varphi) = \sin(\gamma_b) \tan(\phi)
$$

By using the relation $(1)$ and knowing $\epsilon = (\phi + \theta)$, the angle $\theta$ can be computed with:

$$
\tan(\epsilon \sin(\gamma_b)) = \sin(\gamma_b) \tan(\phi)
$$

$$
\boxed{
	\theta = \frac {\tan^{-1}(\sin(\gamma_b) \tan(\phi))} {\sin(\gamma_b)} - \phi \quad \text{(2)}
}
$$

We can also use the relation $(1)$ to get:
$$
\tan(\varphi) = \tan(\epsilon \sin(\gamma_b))
$$
and
$$
\cos(\varphi) = \frac {\cos(\gamma)} {\cos(\gamma_b)}
$$
$$
\sin(\varphi) = \sin(\phi) \sin(\gamma)
$$
which leads to:
$$
\tan(\varphi) = \frac {\sin(\varphi)} {\cos(\varphi)} = \frac {\sin(\gamma) \sin(\phi) \cos(\gamma_b)} {\cos(\gamma)} = \tan(\gamma) \sin(\phi) \cos(\gamma_b)
$$

The angle $\gamma$ can be expressed as:

$$
\boxed{
	\tan(\gamma) = \frac {\tan \left[ \left( \theta + \phi \right) \sin(\gamma_b) \right]} {\sin(\phi) \cos(\gamma_b)} \quad \text{(3)}
}
$$

When $\gamma = \gamma_p$ and $\phi = \phi_p$, the point $P$ is on the pitch cone circle. Therefore:

$$
\sin(\gamma_b) \tan(\phi_p) = \tan(\gamma_p) \sin(\phi_p) \cos(\gamma_b)
$$
With several simplications, we get:
$$
\boxed{\cos(\phi_p) = \frac {\tan(\gamma_b)} {\tan(\gamma_p)}}
$$

And this expression helps to determine $\theta_p$:
$$
\theta_p = \frac {\tan^{-1}(\sin(\gamma_b) \tan(\phi_p))} {\sin(\gamma_b)} - \phi_p
$$
