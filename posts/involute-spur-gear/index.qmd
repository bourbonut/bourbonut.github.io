Involute gears are the most popular power transmission devices. 
We find them as an essential component for many machines.
For instance, epicyclic gear train is a combination of gears which allows to make a reduction in a compact way.
Spur gears are the most popular form and the most efficient type of gearing.

# Involute function

![Figure : Transmission of torque](force.png)

In order to maximize the transmission effort, we introduce the involute function.
This function is defined as we roll a rope up around a circle.
Then the rope is rolled out while being tight such that its direction is tangent to the circle.
The trajectory of the end point of the rope describes follows the involute function.

![Animation : Involute Function](InvoluteFunction.mp4)

Now, all variables are defined on the following figure :

![Figure : Variables for Involute Function](static_involute.png)

Then we can easily see the formula of the involute function $\vec \theta(r, t)$:
$$
\vec \theta(r, t) = r \ \vec u(t) - r t \ \vec v(t) = r \begin{pmatrix} \cos(t) + t \sin(t) \\ \sin(t) - t \cos(t) \end{pmatrix}
$$

By adding a starting angle, the involute function can be written as :
$$
\boxed{\vec \theta(r, t, t_0) = r \ \vec u(t - t_0) - r t \ \vec v(t - t_0) = r \begin{pmatrix} \cos(t - t_0) + t \sin(t - t_0) \\ \sin(t - t_0) - t \cos(t - t_0) \end{pmatrix}}
$$

```python 
# pip install PyGLM
from glm import *
from maths import cos, sin

def u(t):
    return vec3(cos(t), sin(t), 0)

def v(t):
    return vec3(-sin(t), cos(t), 0)

def involute(t, r, t0=0):
    return r * (u(t - t0) - t * v(t - t0))
```

Note: for `glm`, see [PyGLM](see https://github.com/Zuzu-Typ/PyGLM).

# Dimension of a tooth

There are several dimensions that are normalized in industry :

| Variable | Description | Relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $m$  | the module | Fundamental variable |
| $z$  | the number of teeth | Fundamental variable |
| $\alpha$ | the pressure angle | Fundamental variable |
| $k_a$ | the addendum coefficient usually $k_a = 1$ | Fundamental variable |
| $k_f$ | the dedendum coefficient usually $k_f = 1.25$ | Fundamental variable |
| $h_a$ | the addendum height | $h_a = k_a m$ |
| $h_f$ | the dedendum height | $h_f = k_f m$ |
| $r_p$ | the pitch radius | $r_p = \frac{mz}{2}$ |
| $r_b$ | the base radius | $r_b = r_p \cos(\alpha)$ |
| $r_a$ | the addendum radius | $r_a = r_p + h_a$ |
| $r_f$ | the dedendum radius | $r_f = r_p - h_f$ |

We can start with a simple gear profile :

![Figure: Gear Profile with dimensions](gear_without_interference.png)

On this figure :

- The red circle is the **pitch circle**.
- The yellow circle is the **base circle**.
- The blue inner circle is the **dedendum circle**.
- The blue outer circle is the **addendum circle**.

We saw that the involute function starts from $t_0$ with the base radius $r_b$.
But we also need to know when the involute function stops.
To get this information, we must find $t$ when $\Vert \vec \theta(r_b, t, t_0) \Vert = r_a$.
$$
\begin{align}
    \Vert \vec \theta(r_b, t, t_0) \Vert^2 & =  r_b^2 \left[ \cos(t - t_0) + t \sin(t - t_0)  \right]^2 + \left[ \sin(t - t_0) - t \cos(t - t_0)  \right]^2 \\
    & = r_b^2 \big(\left[ \cos(t - t_0)^2 + \sin(t - t_0)^2 \right] + t^2 \times \left[ \cos(t - t_0)^2 + \sin(t - t_0)^2 \right]  \\
    & + \left[ 2t\cos(t - t_0)\sin(t-t_0) - 2t\cos(t - t_0)\sin(t-t_0) \right]\big) \\
    & = r_b^2 (1 + t^2)
\end{align}
$$

Thus, for any $r_a$, we have :
$$
\boxed{t = \sqrt{\left( \frac{r_a}{r_b} \right)^2 - 1}}
$$
And $t_a$ denotes the angle from the base radius to the addendum radius.

Also, on the figure *Variables for Involute Function*, there is two angles $\delta$ and $\gamma$.
We can find $\gamma$ given $t$:
$$
\tan(\delta) = \frac{rt}{r} = t \implies \boxed{\gamma = t - \delta = t - \text{arctan}(t)}
$$

Now, we are able to compute the phase between two involute functions.
We know that the *angle step* is equal to $\frac{2 \pi}{z}$ where $z$ is the number of teeth.
The angle of thickness of a tooth is equal $\frac{\pi}{z}$ which correspond to the angle of the tooth upper the pitch radius in red.
Then the phase is equal to the difference between this angle and the angle of the involute stopping on the pitch angle:
$$
\text{phase} = \frac{\pi}{z} - (t_p - \text{arctan}(t_p)) \quad \text{where} \quad t_p = \sqrt{\left( \frac{r_p}{r_b} \right)^2 - 1}
$$

Then the *empty* part of the profile is made by joining two teeth by passing by the dedendum radius.

# Verification with the kinematic between a pinion and a rack

Now, it's time to check if this profile is correct. Remember that a pinion must work on a rack.

Let's see the profile of a rack :

![Figure : Rack profile](rack.png)

The yellow line denotes the pitch line of the rack. $h_a$ and $h_f$ are computed in the same way as a gear.

The pitch circle of the pinion must roll the pitch line of the rack :

![Figure : Contact between rack and pinion](rack_and_gear.png)

Do you see any interference ? Let's see closer :

![Animation : Path of a rack's tooth on the pinion](CloseRackOnGear.mp4)

Now, we clearly see that the rack is in interference with the pinion. Then we must find the red function of the previous animation.
You can notice that the movement of the rack of a point on the pitch line and center based on the tooth, has a trajectory of the involute function.

Thus, the interference curve is a translated involute function according to the position of the corners of the rack's tooth.
In other words, we define $\vec \phi(t, r, t_0, X, Y)$ as the interference curve such as :
$$
\vec \phi(t, r, t_0, X, Y) = \vec \theta(t, r, t_0) - X \vec u(t - t_0) + Y \vec v(t - t_0)
$$
where $X$ and $Y$ are determined based the dimensions of the rack, as the distances $X$ and $Y$ from the pitch line dot to one corner.

Based on the figure *Rack profile*, we can find the following relations :
$$
X = h_a \quad \text{and} \quad Y = \frac{\frac{\pi m}{2} - 2 m k_a \tan(\alpha)}{2}
$$

Note we have chosen the left corner of the rack's tooth.

Next we must find the intersection between $\vec \theta(t_1, r_b, t_{01})$ and $\vec \phi(t_2, r_p, t_{02}, X, Y)$ where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the unknown variables.
The equation to get the intersection is to hard to solve manually. Thus we are going to use the [Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to solve this problem.

The function that we want to optimize is defined as :
$$
\vec f(t_1, t_2) = \vec \theta(t_1, r_b, t_{01}) - \vec \phi(t_2, r_p, t_{02}, X, Y)
$$
Note this function is a 2D vector.

Thus, its derivative is the jacobian matrix :
$$
J(t_1, t_2)
= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial \vec f}{\partial t_1} \cdot \vec x & \frac{\partial \vec f}{\partial t_2} \cdot \vec x \\
\frac{\partial \vec f}{\partial t_1} \cdot \vec y & \frac{\partial \vec f}{\partial t_2} \cdot \vec y
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
\vec \theta'(t_1, r_b, t_{01}) & -\vec \phi'(t_2, r_p, t_{02}, X, Y)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
To get quickly derivatives of these functions, we start by computing the derivatives of $\vec u(t - t_0)$ and $\vec v(t - t_0)$ :
$$
\vec u'(t - t_0) = \vec v(t - t_0) \quad \text{and} \quad \vec v'(t - t_0) = -\vec u(t - t_0)
$$

Thus, we deduce the following derivatives :
$$
\boxed{
    \begin{align}
        \vec \theta'(t_1, r_b, t_{01}) & = r_b t_1 \vec u(t - t_{01}) \\
        \vec \phi'(t_2, r_p, t_{02}, X, Y) & = \vec \theta'(t_2, r_p, t_{02}) - X \vec v(t - t_{02}) - Y \vec u(t - t_{02})
    \end{align}
}
$$
Now, all elements are found to be exploited in order to get a new profile.

And the gear profile :

![Figure : Gear profile with interference](gear_with_interference.png)

Note the closest radius to the pinion's center is greater than the dedendum radius due to the interference curve.

Let's see the rack movement now :

![Animation : Rack moving around the pinion](RackOnGear.mp4)

# Conclusion

That's it! Now you are able to make a correct spur pinion that follows the kinematic rules between rack and itself.
