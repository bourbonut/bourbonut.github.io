# Federated Learning

## Introduction
Federated Learning (FL) was introduced by McMahan et al. (2017) which has attracted increasing interest of ML researchers.
They proposed a decentralized collaborative approach that uses multiple devices to train a global model without sharing their local data.
In most cases, devices are limited in resources such as computation and communication and restricted by the usage of the user.
Federated Learning can meet expectations of specific fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, health care, transportation, finance, smart city, robotics, networking, blockchain and others.
In other words, the fact of training a model without exchanging local data gives an overview of new possibilities for taking advantage of each other while keeping privacy.

## Overview

Federated Learning (FL) is a method where multiple devices (called *clients*) are led to collaborate together with communications to a *central server* in order to train a global model while protecting privacy.
In other words, instead of sharing the local data of users, only updates of local models on clients' devices are communicated to the server.

FL can be applied in various situations.
For instance, in mobile phones there is a large amount of data, which is private by nature.
The data could be acquired through GPS locations, microphones or cameras for example.
If we want to build a global model such as takes account all contributions of all mobile phones, there are risks and responsibilities to deal with private data.
FL aims to build a joint Machine Learning model (ML) without sharing local data.
This technique could help diverse fields to collaborate together in order to train a global model that would be used by all participants.
For instance, in hospitals, where privacy about health data, is the most important criterion, they could build an organization to perform a ML model in collaboration and every of them would take advantage of each others while keeping privacy.
Another way to see FL application is when the implementation of the algorithm is fully decentralized.
In other words, when FL architecture is based on **peer-to-peer**, communications between the server and devices are not required.
For example, this approach offers new types of applications such as attack detection model that could be develop jointly by multiple banks.
