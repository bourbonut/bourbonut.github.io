Bevel gears are designed to transmit mechanical energy between intersecting shafts.
However, to design them in a CAD software can be a tough task.

# Involute function

Historically, bevel gears were imagined and designed to be spherical gears.
However, due to difficulties to machine them, they are designed based on cone shape instead of a sphere.

In order to find the involute function for bevel gears, we should imagine a sphere where a pinion gear profile and a wheel gear profile are projected on a sphere.

## Bevel gear section

![Figure 1 : Bevel gear section](section.png)

There are several fundamental dimensions to know in order to define the involute function :

| Variable      | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| $m$           | the module                                    |
| $z$           | the number of teeth                           |
| $\alpha$      | the pressure angle                            |
| $k_a$         | the addendum coefficient usually $k_a = 1$    |
| $k_f$         | the dedendum coefficient usually $k_f = 1.25$ |
| $r_p$         | the pitch radius                              |
| $r_b$         | the base radius                               |
| $\gamma_p$    | the pitch cone angle                          |
| $\gamma_b$    | the base cone angle                           |
| $\gamma_r$    | the addendum cone angle                       |
| $\gamma_f$    | the dedendum cone angle                       |
| $\rho_1$      | the external sphere radius                    |
| $\rho_0$      | the internal sphere radius                    |

Some relations are already known such as :

$$
r_p = \frac{m \cdot z} {2}
$$

$$
\rho_1 = \frac{2}{3} \rho_0
$$

::: {.callout-tip}
Since the difference between $\rho_1$ and $\rho_0$ is equivalent to the tooth depth, its relation can be reworked and adapted with a third parameter which would be the *tooth depth*.
:::

### Pitch radius

On the figure 1, we can easily find a direct relation between $\rho_1$ and addendum, pitch, base and dedendum radii $r$ with their cone angle $\gamma$:

$$
\rho_1 = \frac{r}{\sin(\gamma)}
$$

More specifically, for the pitch radius $r_p$ and the pitch cone angle $\gamma_p$, the relation is:

$$
\boxed{
    \rho_1 = \frac{r_p}{\sin(\gamma_p)} = \frac{m z}{2 \sin(\gamma_p)}
}
$$

### Addendum and dedendum cone angles

On the figure 1, the following relations can be found :
$$
\gamma_f = \gamma_p + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {k_a m} {\rho_1}\right) = \gamma_p + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {2 k_a \sin(\gamma_p)} z\right)
$$

$$
\gamma_r = \gamma_p - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {k_d m} {\rho_1}\right) = \gamma_p - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {2 k_d \sin(\gamma_p)} z\right)
$$

where $z$ is the number of teeth, $\gamma_p$ is the pitch cone angle, $k_a$ is the addendum coefficient, usually equals to $1$ and $k_f$ is the dedendum coefficient, usually equals ot $1.25$.

## Transmission and impact of pressure angle

Like spur gears, bevel gears are rolling on an imagined rack which, instead of being a straight, is defined on a sphere.
The pitch line of the rack becomes a pitch circle and the radius of this specific circle is the radius of the sphere on which the pinion and the wheel profiles are defined ($\rho_1$).

![Figure 2 : Transmission and impact of pressure angle](flat.png)

This figure highlights several paramaters such as the pressure angle $\alpha$, the pitch cone angle $\gamma_p$ and the base cone angle $\gamma_b$.
Pinion base circle is colored in <span style="background:#100F0F; color:#83c167;border-radius: 5px;padding:2px;">green</span> and wheel base circle is colored in <span style="background:#100F0F; color:#fc6255; border-radius: 5px;padding:2px;">red</span>.

The pinion and the wheel are constantly in contact on the point $P$ which is the intersection point between pinion pitch circle and wheel pitch circle (not shown on the figure).

::: {.callout-note}
In reality, if we would like to be precise, the point of contact would be a straight line with a length of $\rho_1$ (sphere radius) and formed by the intersection between the pinion pitch cone and the wheel pitch cone.
However it can be summarize only by their cone bases.
:::

Pinion and wheel base circles are in contact on points $M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively with the rotated circle by $\alpha$.

The horizontal circle is the pitch circle of the rack on which both pinion and wheel pitch circles are rolling on.

On figure 2, points $M_1$ and $M_2$ are normal to their spherical centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ which means the angles $\widehat{O_1M_1P}$ and $\widehat{O_2M_2P}$ are equal to $\pi / 2$ (i.e. $90째$).

Also the angles $\widehat{O_1PM_1}$ and $\widehat{O_2PM_2}$ are equal to $\pi / 2 - \alpha$ (i.e. $90째 - \alpha$).

By using the [law of sinus (section *Spherical law of sines*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines), we can determine the following relation:

$$
\frac {\sin(\gamma_b)} {\sin(90째 - \alpha)} = \frac {\sin(\gamma_p)} {\sin(90째)}
$$

Which gives us
$$
\sin(\gamma_b) = \cos(\alpha) \sin(\gamma_p)
$$

$$
\boxed{\gamma_b = \sin^{-1}(\cos(\alpha) \sin(\gamma_p))}
$$

The more the pressure angle $\alpha$ increases, the more the base cone angle $\gamma_b$ increases and the base radius $r_b$ becomes smaller.

## Roll of spherical circle on base cone

As we saw, the base cone is rolling on a sphere circle.
It is the same movement by changing view point and saying the base cone is fixed and the sphere circle in rolling around the base cone.

![Animation : Roll of a spherical circle on the base cone](involute-animation.mp4)

To find the involute function colored in <span style="background:#100F0F; color:#fc6255; border-radius: 5px;padding:2px;">red</span>, some intermediate parameters must be introduced.

![Figure 3 : Parameters for involute function](involute.png)

On the figure 3, $r_b$ is the base radius and $\rho_1$ is the sphere radius.
Both <span style="background:#100F0F; color:#ff862f; border-radius: 5px;padding:2px;">orange</span> segments have the same length.
So the angle of the sphere circle has the value:
$$
\phi(t) = \frac{(t - t_0) \times r_b}{\rho_1}
$$

The involute function is named $\overrightarrow{\theta(t)}$ and can be composed with the functions $\overrightarrow{\gamma(t)}$, its derivative is $\overrightarrow{\gamma'(t)}$ and $\phi(t)$:

$$
\overrightarrow{\theta(t)} = \rho_1 \left( \cos(\phi(t)) \frac{\overrightarrow{\gamma(t)}}{\Vert \overrightarrow{\gamma(t)} \Vert} - \sin(\phi(t)) \frac{\overrightarrow{\gamma'(t)}}{\Vert \overrightarrow{\gamma'(t)} \Vert} \right)
$$

The function $\overrightarrow{\gamma(t)}$ is a point on the base circle positioned on the height $\sqrt{\rho_1^2 - r_b^2}$ (Pythagorean theorem). Thus, the function is defined as:
$$
\overrightarrow{\gamma(t)} = \begin{pmatrix}
	r_b \cos(t) \\
	r_b \sin(t) \\
	\sqrt{\rho_1^2 - r_b^2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$\Vert \overrightarrow{\gamma(t)} \Vert$ and $\Vert \overrightarrow{\gamma'(t)} \Vert$ can be computed:

$$
\begin{align}
	\Vert \overrightarrow{\gamma(t)} \Vert & = \sqrt{(r_b \cos(t))^2 + (r_b \sin(t))^2 + \left(\sqrt{\rho_1^2 - r_b^2}\right)^2} \\
										   & = \sqrt{r_b^2 + \rho_1^2 - r_b^2} \\
										   & = \rho_1
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
	\Vert \overrightarrow{\gamma'(t)} \Vert & = \sqrt{(-r_b \sin(t))^2 + (r_b \cos(t))^2} \\
										   & = \sqrt{r_b^2} \\
										   & = r_{b}
\end{align}
$$

Thus we get the following formula for $\overrightarrow{\theta(t)}$:
$$
\boxed{
    \overrightarrow{\theta(t)} = \begin{pmatrix}
        r_b \cos(\phi(t)) \cos(t) + \rho_1 \sin(\phi(t)) \sin(t) \\
        r_b \cos(\phi(t)) \sin(t) - \rho_1 \sin(\phi(t)) \cos(t) \\
        \sqrt{\rho_1^2 - r_b^2} \cos(\phi(t))
    \end{pmatrix}
}
$$

### Simplifications

By using the relation $\frac{r_b}{\rho_1} = \sin(\gamma_p)$ and $r_b = \sin(\gamma_p) \cdot \sin(\gamma_p)$, the following relations can be simplified:
$$
\phi(t) = \frac{(t - t_0) \times r_b}{\rho_1} = \sin(\gamma_b) \cdot (t - t_0)
$$
$$
\sqrt{\rho_1^2 - r_b^2} = \sqrt{\rho_1^2 \times (1 - \sin^2(\gamma_p))} = \sqrt{\rho_1^2 \times \cos^2(\gamma_p)} = \rho_1 \cdot \cos(\gamma_p)
$$

Thus $\overrightarrow{\theta(t)}$ becomes:
$$
\overrightarrow{\theta(t)} = \rho_1 \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
    \sin(\gamma_p) \cos(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot (t - t_0)) \cos(t) + \sin(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot (t - t_0)) \sin(t) \\
    \sin(\gamma_p) \cos(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot (t - t_0)) \sin(t) - \sin(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot (t - t_0)) \cos(t) \\
    \cos(\gamma_p) \cos(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot (t - t_0))
\end{pmatrix}
$$

By doing a change of variable $t$ by $t + t_0$ and normalizing $\overrightarrow{\theta(t)}$, the [involute function]{.underline} of a bevel gear can be written as:
$$
\boxed{
    \overrightarrow{\theta(t)} = \begin{pmatrix}
        \sin(\gamma_p) \cos(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot t) \cos(t + t_0) + \sin(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot t) \sin(t + t_0) \\
        \sin(\gamma_p) \cos(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot t) \sin(t + t_0) - \sin(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot t) \cos(t + t_0) \\
        \cos(\gamma_p) \cos(\sin(\gamma_p) \cdot t)
    \end{pmatrix}
}
$$
